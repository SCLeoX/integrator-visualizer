# Integrator Visualizer
[Try Online](https://scleox.github.io/integrator-visualizer/index.html)

Compare and contrast various numerical integrators on a vector field.

There is only one file. You can view the code by editing the `index.html` file. This is for a single question in an assignment, and it only counts for 10% of that assignment, so don't expect the code quality to be too high.

Also, the feeling when two of your friends announce to you that they have found girlfriends in the same week while you are working on a numerical integrator visualizer really sucks.
